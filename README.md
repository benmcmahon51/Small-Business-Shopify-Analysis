# Small Business Shopify Analysis - Independent Data Analysis Project in Microsoft Excel

## Project Overview:
This project involves an independent analysis of a small business owner's Shopify data. The primary focus is to respect client confidentiality while providing valuable insights into the Shopify store's performance and customer behaviors. The analysis encompasses the following aspects:

* Analyzing the Shopify store's conversion rate based on website traffic metrics.
* Identifying the highest selling styles from the available data.
* Examining customer acquisition through different media channels and purchase counts associated with each channel.
* Analyzing popular keywords searched by customers within the Shopify store.
* Extracting customer demographics and calculating customer density based on purchase data.

The analysis excludes specific product sales metrics and detailed product descriptions to maintain client confidentiality.

## Data:
The analysis is conducted using data from five Excel sheets:

1. **visits_conversions_combined:** Focuses on calculating the Shopify store's conversion rate from website traffic metrics.
2. **styles:** Provides insights into the highest selling styles.
3. **referring_channels:** Displays media channels through which customers accessed the Shopify store, along with associated purchase counts.
4. **storefront_searches:** Details popular keywords searched by customers in the Shopify store.
5. **customer_location:** Derives customer demographics and calculates customer density based on purchase data.

## Note:
* The business owner has chosen to remain anonymous, and thus, specific product sales metrics and product descriptions have been omitted from the analysis to uphold client confidentiality.
* The Microsoft Excel shreadsheets are contained within a Google Drive folder. Please use [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c_06XUj5I7Y1Onhaff2MVKDWeG6FusDZ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114723655502153355356&rtpof=true&sd=true) to access the Google Drive
